    We are vibrant, diverse and the largest student-run organization that aims to serve primarily all Muslim and non-Muslim students and staff at Manchester Metropolitan University. 
    The society primarily aims to serve to the spiritual and academic needs of the Muslim students on campus and to promote the religion of Islam to non-Muslims. 
    We are dedicated to catering the needs of the Muslim students in many ways including providing a clean and functional prayer facility and hosting educational, social and charitable events for students to attend. We also aim to be the representative voice for the Muslim students on campus. 
    We invite everyone to join and aim to unify all Muslims regardless of their age, gender, ability, race, nationality or sect. We welcome you all, whether you are a Muslim, interested in Islam or simply finding a friendly face. You are more than welcome to join us and be part of something wonderful!

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
