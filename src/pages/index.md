      text: To provide excellence in Islamic education in order to balance the
        physical and spiritual development of MMU students. Moreover, Islamic
        education deals with universal education but also education for
        practical life and moral values.

      text: Promoting student cohesion. This is is the process of building shared
        ideals while simultaneously eliminating gaps. The Prophet P.B.U.H
        treated all people well, including non- Muslims. Allah enjoined
        fairness, kindness, good treatment and rendering back trust for Muslims
        and non-Muslims alike

      text: Addressing the needs of MMU students. Islam extends beyond worship and
        preaching, it's also about living, with justice and fairness, to make
        the world better tomorrow than it is today.
